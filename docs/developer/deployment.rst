Client
------

This document provides the basic and detailed setup instructions for new 
Windows environments, specifically for Appleseed development under source control for client projects,
generally deployed on a physical Server or on the Cloud.

Directory Structure
------------------

Below is an overview of the directory structure for deploying a single Anant Application.
Please note for some old clients this is list as C:\Services or C:\Accounts or C:\Sites

- C:\Accounts - Create an accounts directory on the root of the primary drive.  It would be nice if you can store this on a drive other than C:\ as only the OS should reside there.
