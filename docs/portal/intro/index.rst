Understanding Appleseed 
-----------------------

Appleseed solves a problem that faces many organizations in the internet age. How can various online activities of a business be bundled into one location with an easy to use interface? As you can see, itâ€™s not a simple problem to solve. There have been many attempts by others and they have all fallen short of a solution that is both simple and elegant. In our pursuit of that golden solution, we are building Appleseed as a framework for businesses to operate their companies and conduct trade around the world.

Appleseed takes a giant step towards solving this problem by giving businesses a one-stop shop for website changes, social media maintenance, internal operations, and much more. It reduces time and hassle and helps organizations run smoothly and efficiently.

Appleseed has been built to function well with in a variety of legal frameworks and takes into account both international and national trade law.
